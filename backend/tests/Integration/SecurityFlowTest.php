         * 1. Normal account with 5 failed attempts:
         *    - Record failed attempts
         *    - Check that account is not locked after 5 attempts
         *    - On 6th failed attempt: lock account AND ban IP
         *    - Verify subsequent login attempts are blocked
         * 
         * 2. Head admin account with 6 failed attempts:
         *    - Record failed attempts
         *    - Check that account is NOT locked after 6 attempts
         *    - Verify IP is banned
         *    - Account should remain accessible from different IP
         * 
         * 3. Successful login after failed attempts:
         *    - Verify failed attempts counter is reset
         *    - Account unlock after successful login
         * 
         * 4. IP ban functionality:
         *    - Banned IP cannot access login endpoint
         *    - Different IP can still attempt login
         *    - Manual IP ban removal works
         * 
         * 5. Admin functions:
         *    - Unlock account manually
         *    - Remove IP ban manually
         *    - View security statistics
         *    - View failed login history
         * 
         * 6. Time window logic:
         *    - Old failed attempts outside time window don't count
         *    - Recent attempts within time window are counted
         * 
         * 7. Configuration changes:
         *    - Different thresholds work correctly
         *    - Different time windows work correctly
         *    - Different ban durations work correctly
